## Choreography 
The content is presented alphabetically, from A-Z because each flowere is of equal weight or importance to me, and the best way to order them to me unbiasly seemed to be by name alphabetically. 
## Azalea 
#### Description 
Azaleas are flowering shrubs in the genus *Rhododendron*, particularly the former sections *Tsutsuji* (evergreen) and *Pentanthera* (deciduous). Azaleas bloom in the spring and their flowers often lasting several weeks. Azaleas have flower colors including white and various shades of purple, pink, red and reddish orange, but not yellow. Color patterns include single colors and bicolors as well as sectors, stripes and flecks. For many azalea varieties, all the flowers on the plant are similar. 

#### Cultivation 
Plant enthusiasts have selectively bred azaleas for hundreds of years. This human selection has produced over 10,000 different cultivars which are propagated by cuttings. Azalea seeds can also be collected and germinated. Azaleas are generally slow-growing and do best in well-drained acidic soil (4.5–6.0 pH). Fertilizer needs are low. Some species need regular pruning. 
#### Uses 
Azaleas are used in flower festivals in countries around the world. Motoyama, Kōchi has a flower festival in which the blooming of Tsutsuji is celebrated and Tatebayashi, Gunma is famous for its Azalea Hill Park, Tsutsuji-ga-oka. Higashi Village has hosted an azalea festival each year since 1976. The village's 50,000 azalea plants draw an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 visitors each year. Sobaeksan has a royal azalea festival held on May every year. Many cities in the United States have festivals in the spring celebrating the blooms of the azalea, including South Carolina, New Jersey, Alabama, Texas and Florida. 

## Orchid 
#### Description 
Orchids are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant. All orchids are perennial herbs that lack any permanent woody structure. Some orchids have single flowers, but most have a racemose inflorescence, sometimes with a large number of flowers. The flowering stem can be basal, that is, produced from the base of the tuber, like in Cymbidium, apical, meaning it grows from the apex of the main stem, like in Cattleya, or axillary, from the leaf axil, as in Vanda. As an apomorphy of the clade, orchid flowers are primitively zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical), although in some genera, such as Mormodes, Ludisia, and Macodes, this kind of symmetry may be difficult to notice. Orchids can come in shades of pink, purple, red and yellow. 
#### Cultivation 
The other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers. Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical, but quite a few that grow in colder climates can be found on the market. Orchids of all types have also often been sought by collectors of both species and hybrids. Many hundreds of societies and clubs worldwide have been established. The primary use of the term is among orchid hobbyists wishing to describe unusual species they grow, though it is also used to distinguish naturally occurring orchid species from horticulturally created hybrids. 

#### Uses

##### Perfumery
The scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumers to identify potential fragrance chemicals. - 

##### Food 
The dried seed pods of one orchid genus, Vanilla, are commercially important as a flavouring in baking, for perfume manufacture and aromatherapy. The underground tubers of terrestrial orchids are ground to a powder and used for cooking, such as in the hot beverage salep or in the Turkish frozen treat dondurma. Some saprophytic orchid species of the group Gastrodia produce potato-like tubers and were consumed as food by native peoples in Australia and can be successfully cultivated, notably Gastrodia sesamoides. 

## Zinnia 
#### Description 
Zinnias are annuals, shrubs, and sub-shrubs native primarily to North America, with a few species in South America.Most species have upright stems but some have a lax habit with spreading stems that mound over the surface of the ground. They typically range in height from 10 to 100 cm tall (4" to 40"). The leaves are opposite and usually stalkless (sessile), with a shape ranging from linear to ovate, and a color ranging from pale to medium green. The flowers have a range of appearances, from a single row of petals to a dome shape. Zinnias may be white, chartreuse, yellow, orange, red, purple, or lilac.

#### Cultivation
Zinnias are easy to grow with potentially heavy blooms that gush in color. Their petals can take different forms as single row with a visible center (Single-flowered zinnia), numerous rows with a center that is not visible (Double-flowered) and petals that are somewhere in-between with numerous rows but visible centers (Semidouble-flowered zinnia). Their flowers can also take several shapes. Zinnias are an annual plant that are preferably grow in situ from seed, as they dislike being transplanted. Much like daisies, zinnias prefer to have full sunlight and adequate water. In the preferred conditions they will grow quickly but are sensitive to frost and therefore will die after the first frost of autumn. Zinnias benefit from deadheading to encourage further blooming. 

#### Uses 
Zinnias are popular garden flowers because they come in a wide range of flower colors and shapes, and they can withstand hot summer temperatures, and are easy to grow from seeds. They are grown in fertile, humus-rich, and well-drained soil, in an area with full sun. They will reseed themselves each year. Over 100 cultivars have been produced since selective breeding started in the 19th century. A number of species of zinnia are popular flowering plants, and interspecific hybrids are becoming more common. Their varied habits allow for uses in several parts of a garden, and their tendency to attract butterflies and hummingbirds is seen as desirable.
